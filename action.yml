name: 'Configure CF CLI'

description: |
  Installs the latest linux64 binary for the CloudFoundry CLI as outlined in
  https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/blob/master/doc/installation-instructions/installation-instructions-v7.md#installers-and-compressed-binaries.
  When no parameters are given, reverts to install-only mode that stops after
  installing the CF CLI. Otherwise all parameters must be supplied and the
  action will authenticate and target one of dev/test/prod spaces.

inputs:
  cf-username:
    description: 'CloudFoundry username to authenticate with'
    required: true
    default: ''

  cf-password:
    description: 'CloudFoundry password to authenticate with'
    required: true
    default: ''

  cf-org:
    description: 'CloudFoundry Organization to target'
    required: true
    default: ''

outputs:
  target-environment:
    description: |
      The target environment based off the github ref. One of 'dev',
      'test', or 'prod'.
    value: ${{ steps.environment.outputs.environment_name }}
